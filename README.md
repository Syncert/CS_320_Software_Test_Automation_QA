**Takeaways from the Course**

*How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?*
Ensuring functionality and security of any software implementation is a multi-faceted job. 
To ensure software functionality begins at the requirements gathering phase. Thoroughly thinking through, discussing and documenting the needs of the Software are crucial to inform the testing methodology and metrics of success. The final stage of functionality would be writing extensive software testing to eventually incorporate into a CI/CD pipeline. 
To ensure software security involves thorough analyses of the security vectors within the program. When is user input being gathered? How secure are the software packages being used within the program? Regular analyses of software logs, packages used and users being interacted with are essential in this day and age. 

*How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?*
Interpreting user needs involves walking through a variety of use-cases, user stories and a series of beta versions of the software. It's an extensive and time consuming process to interpret user needs, but the closer the user is to the development process the more likely the development process is to align with the user. Scope is an ever evolving piece of software development and it is often that the user wont realize what they want until they see functioning versions of the software in its development. 

*How do I approach designing software?*
Extensive gathering of functional and non-functional user requirements, rapid prototyping, extensive testing of functional and non-functional aspects of the requested software.
